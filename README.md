    Upstream hive (public hive):
        Adjusted the respawn rates of vehicles. Previously all vehicles had pretty long respawn time making them a bit too rare.
        Still requires a server restart for vehicles to show up in-game.
        * [UPDATED] Destroyed low-end (boats, bicycles) vehicles now respawn after 3h.
        * [UPDATED] Destroyed medium-end (normal cars, motorcycle, quads) vehicles respawn after 12h.
        * [UPDATED] Destroyed high-end ( aircraft, all-terrain) vehicles respawn after 24h.
        Note: Respawn rates are our recommended rule set, they may differ on some private hive servers.

    Dogs:

        Dogs can be found around the world roaming.
        Dogs must be tamed using a peace of raw food.
        Tamed dogs can be controlled (This is still limited for now).
        Once tamed dogs will automatically follow unless told to do something else.
        Dogs Need Food (rawsteak) new icon will apear.
        Dogs Need Water (WaterBottle) new icon will apear.

        If your dog dies you can gut it.

    Basic Controls:

        Sit - Tells your dog to sit.
        Lie - Tells your dog to lie down.
        Stay - Tells your dog to stay in its current location. Dogs will get bored if left.
        Track - Tells your dog to find the closest animal within 900m.
        Call - Calls your dog back. (Cancels all current commands).

    Dog Problems:

        Sometimes get stuck going up/down steep slopes; very slow movement at best.
        Sometimes "loses" player and dosent follow again till player approches dog; sometimes a "Call Dog" fixes the issue.
        Sometimes repeating sit/lay down animations when in waiting mode beside player; often occurs with the Fin model. Always occurs with more than one dog.
